This package can be installed via Composer:

```bash
composer require spatie/crawler
```

No additional setup is needed. The crawler works out of the box.

If you want to crawl JavaScript rendered pages, you'll also need to install [Browsershot](https://github.com/spatie/browsershot) and its dependencies:

```bash
composer require spatie/browsershot
```

Check the [Browsershot requirements](https://spatie.be/docs/browsershot/v2/requirements) for details on installing Puppeteer and Chrome.
